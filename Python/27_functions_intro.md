# 27 Functions (Definition & Invocation)

Group reusable logic inside a named block.

## Core Concepts
- Define with `def name():`.
- Call by writing the name followed by parentheses.
- Code inside runs only when called.

## Example (Ready to Run)
```python
def greet_user():
    print('Hi there!')
    print('Welcome aboard')

print('Start')
greet_user()
print('Finish')
```

## Explanation
- The function is defined first, then invoked later.
- Separation improves readability and reuse.

## Exercises
1. Define `say_goodbye()` that prints a farewell.
2. Call it twice with other print statements before/after.

## Key Takeaways
- Functions avoid repetition.
- Always define before calling in simple scripts.
