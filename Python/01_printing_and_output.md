# 01 Printing & Basic Output

This lesson introduces the `print()` function and string repetition.

## Core Concepts
- `print()` outputs text to the console.
- Strings can be multiplied by an integer to repeat them.
- Python executes statements from top to bottom.

## Example Code (Ready to Run)
```python
print("Bartek :D")
print("This is dog!")
print("o----")
print(" ||||")

# Repeat a character 10 times
print("*" * 10)
```

## Explanation
- Each `print()` call writes a line.
- The expression `"*" * 10` produces `"**********"` (string multiplication creates a new string by repetition).

## Try It Yourself
Change the number in `"*" * 10` to `25` and observe the output.

## Key Takeaways
- Printing is immediate feedback while learning.
- String multiplication is handy for quick text patterns or separators.
